# 2022

This year I am planning on using a few different languages outside of my comfort zone, mainly to get a feel of their syntax and how they work, as I am looking for new languages to learn. Therefore, do not expect the code to be the most efficient or even idiomatic in any way (not like any of my code is efficient or idiomatic anyway, but whatever).
